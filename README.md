# BuzzHive


Buzzhive is a sophisticated honeypot project designed to emulate a vulnerable system and attract malicious activities for analysis and detection. By capturing and analyzing various types of cyber attacks, Buzzhive provides valuable insights into attack patterns, IP addresses, and attack techniques, aiming to enhance cybersecurity measures and inform mitigation strategies.

"Unleash the power of the hive! Buzzhive turns the tables on hackers, luring them into our virtual trap while we analyze their moves. Get ready to buzz with excitement as we dive into the fascinating world of cyber warfare!" - Your Safeguard Against the Sting of Cyber Threats!

## Key Features

Comprehensive Data Analysis: Buzzhive performs in-depth analysis of captured attack data, uncovering trends, identifying common attack types, and tracing IP addresses involved in malicious activities.
Visual Insights: Buzzhive offers visually appealing and informative charts and plots to help you better understand the data, including bar plots, pie charts, and histograms.
Advanced Analytics: Take your analysis to the next level with Buzzhive's advanced analytics capabilities, allowing you to explore correlations, patterns over time, and detect anomalies.
Reporting and Results: Buzzhive generates detailed analysis reports and saves the results, providing a comprehensive overview of the captured attack data.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the Buzzhive project repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/buzzhive.git`.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required Python packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Add Your Data Files**: Place your own data files in the `data/` folder. The data files should follow the same format as the example data files (`honeypot_data.csv`, `honeypot_data2.csv`, `honeypot_data3.csv`).
   - Make sure your data files contain relevant information such as attack type, IP address, and timestamps.
   - You can have multiple data files to analyze different time periods or sources.
4. **Run the Analysis**: Execute the main script by running `python src/main.py`.
5. **Explore Results**: The analysis results, visualizations, and reports will be saved in the `results/` folder.
